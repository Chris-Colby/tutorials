                              <h4>LET'S GET STARTED!</h4>
                         </li>
                         <li>Go to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS
                                   (https://aws.amazon.com)</a> - Sign In to the Console</li>
                         <li>Click Services</li>
                         <li>Click S3</li>
                         <li>Click Create Bucket</li>
                         <li>In “Bucket name” text field - Name the Bucket - <strong>NOTE</strong>: (no spaces, only
                              valid characters - no ".com"
                              necessary) - AWS provides a link underneath for “Rules for bucket naming” - Do not include
                              dots in the name!</li>
                         <li>AWS Region - Choose Region - <strong>NOTE</strong>: for me, this is “US East (N. Virginia)
                              us-east-1”. The bucket's Region
                              may be pre-selected above Bucket Name text field....mine was the most recent time I did
                              this.</li>
                         <li>Scroll to bottom - Click Create Bucket</li>
                         <li>Click on the newly created bucket</li>
                         <li>See tabs across the top</li>
                         <li>Next, upload my website files to my new bucket by clicking Upload button</li>
                         <li><strong>NOTE</strong>I choose to drag and drop. I did not move JOJ master folder over,
                              rather, open the folder on my desktop,
                              select and drag all the folders and files from within my Master Folder and drag them into
                              the AWS upload box.
                              Ex. go to my JOJ master folder, open it and select all the individual files
                              and folder inside the joj master folder and drag all the individual folders and files into
                              S3 Upload area.</li>
                         <li>Click the Upload button</li>
                         <li>After upload completes - get green Upload Succeeded!</li>
                         <li>Single click on index.html file - Now taken to a new tab - will see owner, last modified,
                              size, key. Can also - if lots of files and folders to fit on one page - maybe this is
                              better:
                              under “Files and folders” click on the file
                              under the Name tab - - in search field “Find by name” - can input either index or the page
                              I'd like to see.</li>
                         <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: the OBJECT URL (inside the properties tag in the Object Overview
                              box) - this
                              represents the file inside AWS - and can be used for public access - but, just because AWS
                              creates this file usable for public access does not mean that the html file / this link is
                              accessible</li>
                         <li>TRY opening the Object URL link in another tab - will get error - XML file does not appear
                              to have any style info. Code Access Denied, Message Access Denied, etc. This means
                              that the file is not made public (yet) - I don not have the proper public permissions yet
                         </li>
                         <li>Go back to Object Overview tab - In the same index.html overview tab, click the Open
                              button. Now
                              I can see the file contents. <strong>NOTE</strong>: the website won’t show up as finished
                              product - only
                              the html shows up - the skeleton - latest-my photos didn't show up. Example, click any
                              link and I get the XML error / Access
                              Denied message. Simply uploading all of our files does not mean our website is going to
                              work.
                              We need to complete more steps. In the above steps, I created my bucket and uploaded my
                              files.</li>
                         <li>

                         </li>
                         <li>Navigate to AWS S3 - Top Left: Click Services (make sure I'm still logged in)</li>
                         <li>Click S3</li>
                         <li>Click on my bucket</li>
                         <li>Select PROPERTIES tab</li>
                         <li>Scroll down - In STATIC WEBSITE HOSTING area Click Edit button - This is the configuration
                              I need to set to enable my bucket to host my website</li>
                         <li>Under “Static website hosting” Select ENABLE (Radio Button) / more info appears</li>
                         <li>Select - Enable - under static website hosting</li>
                         <li>More options present themselves — go to index document text box and type in index.html - to
                              denote that this is the document I want displayed when someone types in my url - this is
                              my main homepage</li>
                         <li>Optional - enter in the error.html document - the document that gets displayed when a user
                              tries to access pages that are not available - can make this page really cool - either
                              way, enter an html document here - with directions and a link back to the homepage. Note -
                              this is
                              the page with the redirection rules and notes. Optional, but considerate. It's good form.
                         </li>
                         <li>Click Save Changes button - I got a green note and check mark - “Successfully edited static
                              website hosting” message in green bar up top</li>
                         <li>Doublecheck that the static website hosting is enabled - scroll down on the properties
                              tab/page - it should have some info in it now - remeber to copy the http link created for
                              my site</li>
                         <li>Above, we generated an endpoint URL - and configured my error page
                              <strong>NOTE</strong>: my endpoint url - it looks something like this:
                              http://MY-BUCKET-NAME.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
                              Note - when I tried to open this, I got the 403 Forbidden message. Access denied - -
                              This is normal, see below…
                         </li>
                         <li>
                              <h4>Next Part - configure security and Permissions - to make my site public for users on
                                   the
                                   internet</h4>
                         </li>
                         <li>Navigate back to AWS S3 - Top Left: Click Services (make sure I'm still logged in)</li>
                         <li>Click S3</li>
                         <li>Click on my bucket</li>
                         <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: by default s3 objects are not made public even when bucket hosting
                              is enabled. Even
                              if an endpoint is configured, still no go!!! - trying it gives us an hsttp 403 error -
                              access denied - go ahead - paste my endpoint url and will get 403 forbidden. To remedy
                              this, need to perform 2 actions in my bucket:
                              1 - Need to unblock public access to my bucket, AND 2 - make my website files public</li>

                         <li>Goto AWS console - click services - Storage-S3</li>
                         <li>Click on the bucket I want to open configuration tabs</li>
                         <li>Click on PERMISSIONS TAB</li>
                         <li>Click on EDIT under Block public access (bucket settings)</li>
                         <li>UNCHECK box “Block all public access”</li>
                         <li>Doublecheck that all other checkboxes in this section are unchecked</li>
                         <li>Click SAVE CHANGES button - Caution box appears</li>
                         <li>Type in “confirm” in the caution box</li>
                         <li>Click Confirm Button</li>
